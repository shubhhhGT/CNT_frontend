          Disputes And Jurisdiction
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Disputes will be resolved through a two-step Alternate Dispute
          Resolution (ADR) process:
        </p>
        <ol className=" list-decimal">
          <li>
            <span className=" text-richblack-5">Mediation: </span> A neutral
            third-party mediator, agreed upon by both sides, will attempt to
            resolve the dispute. The mediatorâ€™s decision is not binding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className=" text-richblack-5">Arbitration: </span> If
            mediation fails, arbitration follows with a three-member board (one
            appointed by each party and a third chosen by them). The arbitration
            will be held in Kolkata, India, conducted in English, and the
            decision will be final and binding.

        </ol>
        <p className=" text-[#d23823] text-xs mb-5">
          Note: If unresolved, disputes will be referred to courts in Kolkata,
